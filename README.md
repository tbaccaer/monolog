## About

Monolog is a high-availability query engine and triple store for handling Linked Data. It is an
artifact of my thesis “Monolog: Querying Linked Data with High Availability”, which is currently
in the process of being written. This is a research project, and therefore I can and will not
provide any guarantees for support at the current stage in the project.

## Usage

It is assumed you have both `git` and `Rust` tooling installed. More usage information will follow
once this is actually available for use.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:tbaccaer/monolog && cd monolog && cargo run
```
